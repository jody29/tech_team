### The feature


## :computer: How to install
Before you start, make sure you have Git, npm and Node.js installed on your computer.</br>
Then you can install my feature by following these simple steps: 
1. Clone the repository by running this code in your terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jody29/tech_team.git
```
2. Install all the npm packages by running this code in your terminal:</br> You should see a node_modules folder in the root when it is finished.
```
$ npm install
```
3. Create a database with MongoDB Atlas. This link will help you do it: https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/ </br>
4. In your **database collection** you should make documents like this:</br>  
``` js
_id: objectId(" "), <-- this one will be there automatically
<HERE COMES TEH DATABASE STRUCTURE>
```

5. Create a ``.env`` file in the root of the folder. Place the following code in the ``.env`` file
```
DB_NAME = <Here comes your databasename>
M_URL = <Here comes your URL>
SESSION_SECRET = <here comes you session key>
APIKEY = <Here comes your API key>
```

And then you are good to go! :thumbsup: </br>
